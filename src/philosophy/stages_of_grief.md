# 5 stages of grief


The 7 stages of project:

1. Denial
2. Anger
3. Bargaining 
4. Depression 
5. Acceptance 
6. Saturday 
7. Sunday

The list you provided appears to be a humorous twist on the traditional "five stages of grief," which is a psychological model describing the emotional stages that people may go through when dealing with loss or difficult situations. In this humorous version:

1. Denial: At the beginning of a project, people might deny the challenges or complexities it involves.
2. Anger: As the project progresses and difficulties arise, frustration and anger can be common reactions.
3. Bargaining: This stage might involve attempts to negotiate or find shortcuts to make the project easier.
4. Depression: When facing setbacks or obstacles, it's not uncommon for people to feel a sense of sadness or hopelessness.
5. Acceptance: Ultimately, people come to terms with the project and its challenges.

The last two stages, "Saturday" and "Sunday," appear to be a playful addition and don't correspond to traditional project stages. They could suggest that, after the hard work of the project is done, people look forward to the weekend or a break. It's a lighthearted take on project management or dealing with challenges.
