# Mesh Network

Can an incentive system be built for a mesh network? How can payments be made to service provider by users who use Wi-Fi over the internet? One could create a smart contract for each Wi-Fi router, where people pay in tokens (perhaps including USDT) to access the internet."


One can use wireless bridge to expand the network, 20KM: [Outdoor Wireless Bridge](https://www.amazon.in/20-11ac-Outdoor-Wireless-Bridge/dp/B084DKMWPB/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1TS5L8K8QI9ZS&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.emYyaG6gf0TdpUbCO5D8aTDewobwH9JHbtB-VABf52awP0zH7pOJabjGUj5SCL7vf-E1pA2A3Iw908YQTwub66WLNlbca7sqQgXCF3hSjxoQ0MLltmzcAy7IgEyhR6rcRMcUuJ_RKaLSRX0diqZ2wg._JKz9RGogW7erEuk53vTX9r5Xm6cX44ptJWgDfLF8xg&dib_tag=se&keywords=10+km+wifi+AC+bridges&qid=1708235044&sprefix=10+km+wifi+ac+bridge%2Caps%2C319&sr=8-3)

## For network braodband tracking


[Wireshark on Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-and-use-wireshark-on-ubuntu-linux/)



One can use raspberry pi zero to [run the wireshark](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-wireshark/)


## Rust package to handle data

<https://docs.rs/rtshark/latest/rtshark/>

## Get the broadband statistics, upload it to blockchain, every day

Parse the braodband statistics, and upload it to blockchain

Two types of account:

    1) Service provider
   
    2) Service User


## Transfer the funds from the user to the service provider based on statistics

It is a prepaid system. Users can switch service providers within a day. This helps promote competition and eliminates fraudulent or non-reliable service providers.


More reliable mesh network where service provider can also become user, in case of network failure of service provider. 

## Other incentives

In addition, other incentives, such as staking to gain interest, rewards for providing reliable service, and bonuses for registering for the service, can be provided.
