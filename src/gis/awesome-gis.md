## Ideas to build

[Building the World’s First Blockchain Geospatial Network Backed with Cryptography](https://www.geospatialworld.net/prime/interviews/building-the-worlds-first-blockchain-geospatial-network-backed-with-cryptography/)


XYO calls itself the world’s first Reality Oracle, which empowers people to participate in the global data economy through the validation of anonymous and secure geospatial data.

XYO has created a reliable Data Ocean, meaning it collects data from various sources and pools it together for verification and analysis. Just as rivers flow towards an ocean, “rivers” of data from the nodes in the XYO Network all run towards the larger XYO Data Ocean, providing an aggregated place for data. After the data is collected and aggregated, the cryptographic protocol can help validate and improve the trust for that collected data.


### Geotagging

Geotagging, or GeoTagging, is the process of adding geographical identification metadata to various media such as a geotagged photograph or video, websites, SMS messages, QR Codes or RSS feeds and is a form of geospatial metadata. This data usually consists of latitude and longitude coordinates, though they can also include altitude, bearing, distance, accuracy data, and place names, and perhaps a time stamp.

### Environmental Monitoring 

Impact Assessment: Monitor environmental impacts of business operations, such as pollution levels, deforestation, or water usage.

Regulatory Compliance: Ensure compliance with environmental regulations by tracking and reporting necessary data.

e.g. Monetizing tree plantation with blockchain and monitoring it with GIS.


### Supply Chain and Logistics Optimization

Route Optimization: Use GIS to determine the most efficient delivery routes, reducing fuel costs and delivery times.

Asset Tracking: Monitor the location of assets in real-time, ensuring better management and reducing the risk of theft or loss.



### Agriculture

Precision Farming: Use GIS to monitor crop health, soil conditions, and weather patterns, optimizing planting and harvesting schedules.

Resource Management: Track the usage of water, fertilizers, and pesticides to ensure sustainable farming practices.

### Urban Planning

Smart Cities: Implement GIS in urban planning to develop smart city initiatives, such as traffic management, waste management, and public safety.

Public Services: Optimize the location and distribution of public services like schools, hospitals, and parks.


### Healthcare

Epidemiology: Track the spread of diseases geographically to plan public health responses.

Resource Allocation: Optimize the placement of healthcare facilities and resources based on population health data.
